# yellow-vein-mosaic-disease-prediction-in-okra-leaves

The goal of this project is to help farmers to identify 'Yellow Vein Mosaic Disease' at early stage of disease and suggest pesticides to control and to stop the further spread of disease and this particular disease is a major diseasae in okra plants and it also spread through whiteflies from one plant to another plant and effects the growth of the every okra plant. so me and my friend teja collected data of 2000(helthy & diseased leaves of okra) from our nearest field to create a model, after data collection we organised data in train,validation and test folders and our tainning data consists of 1,587 images(helthy & diseased leaves) and for validation and testing we used 274 images,88 images. after preprocessing of images we started training simple cnn model with 4 conv2d layers and each layer followed by maxpooling layer and we have used dense layer at end. This simple cnn model started showing very good results, after training model for 25 epochs we got train accuracy of 98 and validation accuracy of 94 but this model failed miserably for test images and auc_roc score for test images is just 0.52, so we have used data augumentation technique, after augumentation we again trained same cnn model and after 25 epochs we got training accuracy of 92 and validation accuracy of 93 and for test images results very poor , roc_auc score is just 0.5 this time. so we moved to transfer learning and trained vgg19 with our custom dense layers at end, after 25 epochs training accuracy is 99 and validation accuracy is 98 and for testing the  roc_auc score is good i.e 0.89. so overall we
have achieved good results with vgg19 and we use it as our final model to make predictions.

I would like to thank my friend teja for helping me to collect the data and to study the disease more deeply, without him this project is not possible.
